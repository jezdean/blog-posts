There's still some to go but the main bits of the website are now up. 

There are four main sections in the navbar above:

* [**Program** section](https://microbit-playground.co.uk/programs/) [[repository](https://github.com/microbit-playground/programs)]
* [**Components** section](https://microbit-playground.co.uk/components/) [[repository](https://github.com/microbit-playground/components)]
* [**Blog posts** section](https://microbit-playground.co.uk/blog/) [[repository](https://github.com/microbit-playground/blog-posts)]
* [**How to** section](https://microbit-playground.co.uk/howto/) [[repository](https://github.com/microbit-playground/programs)]

Each webpage page in each section is made from `.md` files in github repositories. You can add files to the repositories and they'll show up on the website.

Add your details to the [author repository](https://github.com/microbit-playground/author-database) for your contribution to be recorded on the site.

There's more information about contributing in the `README.md` of each repository and there's an overview on the [contributing page](https://microbit-playground.co.uk/about/how-to-contribute).
